## Insurance App ReactJs

This app displays different `Insurance plans` on the home page. After the user selects the plan then the app asks the user for info like emailId, age, gender, etc. When the user completes the form and clicks on the `Submit` button, the application sends the information (all the answers and the selected insurance package) to `www.example.com`.
